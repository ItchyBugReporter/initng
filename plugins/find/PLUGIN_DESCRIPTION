   description : When starting a new service initng, usually needs the full/service/path/to
                 and will fail when not found, this plugin will search the /etc/initng dir,
		 so ngc -u to will automaticly start "full/service/path/to"
		 find plugin also support an alias file where you can put in complatly strange
		 conversations like ngc -u animals/cow will start "animals/pig" :-)
