   description : A service meens a object with an start and maby an stop launcher.
                 It works by that starting an object the start code run, when it
		 finishes, and succeed, the object is set to UP, later when stopping
		 it the stop code is run, and when that finishes, the object got status
		 DOWN. This is not like a daemon works, that is up when launced.
