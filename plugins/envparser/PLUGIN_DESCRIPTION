   description : After a service is parsed, initng may parse an environment
                 file and add these entrys aswell to the db.
		 By an env_file i meen a file with entrys like TEST=hello,
		 TEST2="This is a string", no bash code will be executed in
		 this file, if you want that source within the bash script instead.
