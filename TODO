- Provide replacements for telinit, shutdown and the like, so we can remove
  the initctl plugin. Is better to do this stuff outside of initng.
  (the replacements can be scripts :D)

- Make reload plugin, save sys_state, and current runlevel and more static
  global stuff. Maby we can call ngc -c, when system is stopping or starting
  without problems.

- Add need deps like need = (daemon/sysvlog || daemon/syslogd), needs core
  rewrite.

- A service that stops because the dependency stoped, will atomaticly be
  started again when the dep is up again. Need to rewrite pars of core to
  make this nice?

- dbus work, for a dbusc plugin. [BIG_TASK]

- Fix devices/printer like services, maby using hal? [BIG_TASK]

- Fix the/A xml parser. [BIG_TASK]

- create ngc5 with an shiny new xml data backend. [BIG_TASK]

- Remove doc/initng_hooks.txt and document the new static event_types.
