High priority:

- Make everything thread-safe .
- Implement a logging facility.
- Implement good memory management.
- Implement asynchronous I/O.

Medium priority:

- Implement external events.
- Reimplement sfiles stuff in an event-driven way.

Low priority:

- Provide replacements for telinit, shutdown and the like, so we can
  completely replace sysvinit when INSTALL_AS_INIT.

  Is better to do this stuff outside of initng, and do not depend on
  initctl.

  The replacements can be scripts.

- Make reload module, save sys_state, and current runlevel and more static
  global stuff. Maby we can call ngc -c, when system is stopping or starting
  without problems.

- Add need deps like need = (daemon/sysvlog || daemon/syslogd), needs core
  rewrite.

- A service that stops because the dependency stoped, will atomaticly be
  started again when the dep is up again. Need to rewrite pars of core to
  make this nice?

- Fix devices/printer like services, maby using hal? [BIG_TASK]

- Remove doc/initng_hooks.txt and document the new static event_types.
