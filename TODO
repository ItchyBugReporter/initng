These thing is my (jimmys) private todo list.
They are arranged in my priority, but i got a werry little time to code right now, i am
working overtime to pay my living you know, so dont expect mutch soon.

UP_CHECK hook is not ever checked or called, fix.

Make reload plugin, save sys_state,
	and current runlevel and more static global stuff.
	Maby we can call ngc -c, when system is stopping or starting without problems.

Add need deps like need = (daemon/sysvlog || daemon/syslogd), needs core rewrite too.

The i parser shud not only know '=' but '+=' and '=+' or maby '=-' to reset a multistring variable, needs core rewrite.

a service that stops becouse the dependency stoped,
	will atomaticly be started again when the dep is up again.
	Need to rewrite pars of core to make this nice?
