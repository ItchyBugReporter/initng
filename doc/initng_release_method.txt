1. Prologue

    This document establishes the release method, to avoid any
    inconsistencies between releases, and to ease the task for new release
    managers and package maintainers.


2. Updating the documentation files

    It's necessary to update the NEWS or Changelog file with any relevant
    changes since the last release. This doesn't apply to pre-releases.

    Entries should be marked with the release date (GMT).

    For pre-releases, a file called RELEASE_NOTES should be built,
    containing all known bugs relevant for the next release, and any
    relevant changes done since the last release, this file shouldn't be
    put in the repository.


3. Updating distribution's package meta-data

3.1. Updating the deb's meta-data
3.2. Updating the rpm's meta-data
3.3. Generating ebuilds


4. Tagging the release

    Before proceeding to packaging, you need to tag the release. It's as
    easy as doing:

    $ svn cp [-r rev] https://svn.initng.org/initng/trunk \
                      https://svn.initng.org/initng/tags/x.y.z


5. Packaging and naming conventions

5.1. Source tarballs

    bzipped tarballs are mandatory, gzipped ones are optional, and should
    be named initng[-component]-<version>[_pre#]

    They must be GPG signed by the release manager.

    Pre-releases should include the RELEASE_NOTES file.


5.2. Binary packages

    The package maintainers for distributions are responsible of the
    package generation, and for signing it (if applicable).

    These packages should follow the naming conventions of their respective
    distributions.

    Binary packages are optional for pre-releases.

    Pre-releases should include the RELEASE_NOTES file.


5.2.1. Generation of deb packages
5.2.2. Generation of rpm packages


6. Upload the release

    You simply need to copy your locally generated files and signatures to
    the server:

    $ scp initng-<version>.tar.bz2 initng-<version>.tar.bz2.sign \
      [username@]www.initng.org:/home/initng/ftp/initng/initng/vX.Y

    $ scp initng-ifiles-<version.tar.bz2 initng-ifiles-<version>.tar.bz2.sign \
      [username@]www.initng.org:/home/initng/ftp/initng/initng-ifiles/vX.Y


7. Update the wiki

    WikiStart: Update the NEWS section.
