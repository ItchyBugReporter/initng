1. Prologue

    This document establishes the release method, to avoid any
    inconsistencies between releases, and to ease the task for new release
    managers and package maintainers.


2. Branching

    This is the first step, as you shouln't modify any file in trunk until
    you tag the release.

    Before starting, lets define the naming conventions for (pre-)releases
    branches and tags:

        x.y.z[_pre#|.p]

    Where the _pre# suffix is for pre-releases, for example 0.1.0_pre2,
    and the .p is for bugfix releases, for example 0.6.9.2

    pre- and bugfix releases are special cases, they live in trunk and
    x.y.z branch respectively.

    Do it then:

    $ svn cp https://svn.initng.org/initng/trunk \
             https://svn.initng.org/initng/branches/x.y.z

    Please remember the revision number given by the above command, as it
    will be needed for merging changes to trunk.

    Then you need to switch your working-copy to the new branch:

    $ svn switch https://svn.initng.org/initng/branches/x.y.z


3. Updating the documentation files

    It's necessary to update the NEWS or ChangeLog file with any relevant
    changes since the last release. This doesn't apply to pre-releases.

    Entries should be marked with the release date (GMT).

    For pre-releases, a file called RELEASE_NOTES should be built,
    containing all known bugs relevant for the next release, and any
    relevant changes done since the last release. This file shouldn't
    be put in the repo.


4. Updating distribution's package meta-data

4.1. Updating the CMakeLists.txt file

    The main CMakeLists.txt file should be edited to change the version
    number and the codename.


4.2. Updating the deb's meta-data
4.3. Updating the rpm's meta-data
4.4. Generating ebuilds


5. Tagging the release

    Before proceeding to packaging, you need to tag the release. It's as
    easy as doing:

    $ svn cp https://svn.initng.org/initng/braches/x.y.z \
             https://svn.initng.org/initng/tags/x.y.z


6. Merging the changes

    This step doesn't applies to pre-releases.

    We're done with the changes, so we need to merge some of the changes we
    did to files like NEWS.

    First we need to switch the branch again:

    $ svn switch https://svn.initng.org/initng/trunk

    Merge the files:

    $ svn merge -r <brev>:HEAD https://svn.initng.org/initng/tagsbranches/x.y.z/<NEWS|ChangeLog>

    Where <brev> is the revision when we branched.

    Also you need to edit the CMakeLists.txt to update the version information.


7. Packaging

7.1. Source tarballs

    bzipped tarballs are mandatory, gzipped ones are optional, and should
    be named initng[-component]-<version>[_pre#]

    They must be GPG signed by the release manager:

    $ gpg -b file

    Pre-releases should include the RELEASE_NOTES file.


7.2. Binary packages

    The package maintainers for distributions are responsible of the
    package generation, and for signing it (if applicable).

    These packages should follow the naming conventions of their respective
    distributions.

    Binary packages are optional for pre-releases.

    Pre-releases should include the RELEASE_NOTES file.


7.2.1. Generation of deb packages
7.2.2. Generation of rpm packages


8. Upload the release

    You simply need to copy your locally generated files and signatures to
    the server:

    $ scp initng[-component]-<version>[_pre#].tar.bz2 \
          initng[-component]-<version>[_pre#].tar.bz2.sig \
          [username@]www.initng.org:/home/initng/ftp/initng/initng/vX.Y


9. Update the wiki

    This step isn't mandatory for pre-releases.

    The following pages need to be updated after the release:

    * WikiStart: Update the news section.
    * Documents_Release_Page: Basically, you need to put the same info that
      you have put in the NEWS file.


10. Announce the release

    Simply send an e-mail to the mailing list, and post in the forum ;).
